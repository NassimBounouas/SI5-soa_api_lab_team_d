## API Usage

### Receive Order

Send a Json with [POST] http://127.0.0.1:5000/receiveOrder

Example of Json format:
```
{
	"Meal": "Sushi",
	"Restaurant": "Le soleil de l'est",
	"DeliveryAddress": "Campus Templier"
}
```

### Compute Eta

Get a Json with [GET] http://127.0.0.1:5000/computeEta

The **delivery date** is the time estimated by the system for the customer to receive his order.

The **pick up date** is the time estimated by the system for the delivery person to pick up the order from the restaurant.

```
{
    "DeliveryAddress": "Campus Templier",
    "DeliveryDate": 29,
    "Meal": "Sushi",
    "PickUpDate": 17,
